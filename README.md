## [Book](https://dataintensive.net/) written by [Dr. Martin Kleppmann](http://martin.kleppmann.com/) 

Summary: Broad overview of the architecture of data systems and how to choose database for specific applications.

## Part 1 Fundamental ideas
1. Chapter 1 - Terminology
2. Chapter 2 - Data models and Query languages
3. Chapter 3 - Storage engines and Databases
4. Chapter 4 - Data Encoding or Serialization

## Part 2 Distributed storage
5. Chapter 5 - Replication
6. Chapter 6 - Partitioning/Sharding
7. Chapter 7 - Transactions
8. Chapter 8 - Problems with Distributed systems
9. Chapter 9 - Consistency in Distributed system

## Part 3 Derived data
10. Chapter 10 - Batch processing
11. Chapter 11 - Stream processing
12. Chapter 12 - Building reliable, scalable, maintainable applications

### Chapter 1 - Terminology

**Reliability**
>  system continues to work correctly (performing the correct function at the desired level of performance) even in the face of adversity (hardware or software faults, and even human error).

**Scalability**
> As system grows in data volume, traffic volume, or complexity, there should be reasonable ways of dealing with that growth.

**Maintainability**
> Different people can work on the system (maintain current behavior or adapt system to new use cases) productively.
